# Conditional statements and loops
1. Write a program that reads from the console three numbers of type int and prints their sum. 

2. Write a program that reads from the console the radius "r" of a circle and prints its perimeter and area.

3. Write a program that reads from the console two integer numbers (int) and prints how many numbers between them exist, such that the  remainder of their division by 5 is 0. 

Example: in the range (14, 25) there are 3 such numbers: 15, 20 and 25.

4. Write a program that reads two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Solve the problem without using conditional statements.

5. Write a program that reads five integer numbers and prints their sum. If an invalid number is entered the program should prompt the user to enter another number.

6. Write a program that reads five numbers from the console and prints the greatest of them.


7. Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N. The number N should be read from the standard input.

8. Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N, which are not divisible by 3 and 7 simultaneously. The number N should be read from the standard input.

9. Write a program that reads from the console a series of integers and prints the smallest and largest of them.

10. Write a program that converts a given number from decimal to binary notation (numeral system).

11. Write a program that by a given integer N prints the numbers from 1 to N in random order
12 Write program that outputs a triangle made of stars with variable size, depending on an input parameter. Look at the examples to get   an idea.
  The input comes as a string number, which needs to be parsed to a number.
  The output is a series of lines printed on the console, forming a triangle of variable size.
  
   ```Input: 1  
   Output *
   Input 2:   
   Output:    
   **   
   **
   ```
   
  13. A program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50 
For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
 ```
Output : 
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4 
buzz
```

**14**. Write a program that prints three numbers in three virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters and the numbers should be left aligned. The first number should be an integer in hexadecimal; the second should be fractional positive; and the third – a negative fraction. The last two numbers have to be rounded to the second decimal place

**15** A given company has name, address, phone number, fax number, web site and manager. The manager has name, surname and phone number. Write a program that reads information about the company and its manager and then prints it on the console.
